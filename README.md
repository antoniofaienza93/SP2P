## Objectives
The aim of the project is to test the peer to peer functionalities offerted by PeerJs Library. PeerJS wraps the browser's WebRTC implementation to provide a complete, configurable, and easy-to-use peer-to-peer connection API. 
For this, I have created a new Game. In particular the focus of analysis is the Multiplayer section that use and tests the PeerJs functionality.
